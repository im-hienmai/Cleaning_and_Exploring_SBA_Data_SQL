# Cleaning and Exploring SBA_Data With SQL
## Data Source:
The data used for this project was sourced from the U.S. Small Business Administration. The SBA provides access to certain government programs, such as SBA loan programs and contracting opportunities, which are reserved for small businesses. To qualify for these programs, businesses must meet the SBA's definition of a small business concern and adhere to the size standards for small businesses. The dataset used for this project is specifically from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides loans to help small businesses keep their workforce employed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Overview:
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring the SBA_Data using SQL. The dataset was imported into a SQL database using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) for further analysis. The SQL queries provided in this project were used to clean the data, explore various aspects of the dataset, and derive meaningful insights.

#### 3. Exploring Data with SQL

## Usage:
To replicate the project, follow these steps:

- Download the SBA_Data files from the provided data source (https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia).
- Set up a SQL database and create the necessary tables to store the SBA_Data.
- Execute the cleaning queries (Cleaning&Exploring_SBA_Data.sql) to clean and standardize the data.
- Execute the exploration queries (Cleaning&Exploring_SBA_Data.sql) to analyze and derive insights from the cleaned data.

## Conclusion:
Cleaning and exploring the SBA_Data using SQL provides valuable insights into various aspects of the dataset. By leveraging SQL's capabilities, we can transform raw data into a clean and structured format, enabling us to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
